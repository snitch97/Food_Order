Hello,

I worked on the Food Ordering Project, which is a comprehensive web application developed using various technologies.

## Project Content and Features

- Developed with the concept of Single Page Application.
- Created the Front-End infrastructure using React and Next.js technologies.
- Implemented responsive transitions with Tailwind CSS.
- Optimized state management using Redux-Toolkit.
- Simplified user authentication using Next-Auth.
- Handled form controls and data validation with Formik and Yup.
- Utilized MongoDB for database operations.
- Added an Admin Management Panel and implemented user profiles.

## Extra Features Developed by Me

In addition to the core features taught by the course instructors, I added some extra features to enrich the project:

- Enhanced state management with Redux-Toolkit to optimize data flow between different components.
- Implemented a user-friendly error handling mechanism to provide better guidance in case of possible errors.
- Improved database queries for more efficient data processing with MongoDB.
- Implemented the "Order Customization" feature, allowing users to personalize their orders.
